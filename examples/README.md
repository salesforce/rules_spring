## Bazel Spring Boot Rule Examples

Navigate into our examples directories:

- [Hello World](helloworld): bare bones example
- [Demo App](demoapp): demonstrates how to use various features in the rule

The examples above are coresident with the rule itself, which makes them not precise.
Your usage of rules_spring will be as a remote repository.
These same examples are availabe in a dedicated repository:

- [External Demos](https://github.com/plaird/rules_spring_demoapp)

There is also a Kotlin example, which is kept in a separate branch in this repository:

- [KotlinApp](https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/tree/examples_kotlin) shows how to build and run  Spring Boot applications written in Kotlin with *rules_spring*
