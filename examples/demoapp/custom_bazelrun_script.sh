# The following environment variables will be set by the springboot rule, and can
# be reliably used for scripting:
#  RULE_NAME=helloworld
#  LABEL_PATH=examples/helloworld/
#  SPRINGBOOTJAR_FILENAME=helloworld.jar
#  JVM_FLAGS="-Dcustomprop=gold  -DcustomProp2=silver"
#  DO_BACKGROUND=true/false   (if true, the caller is expecting the launcher not to block and return immediately)
#
# There are several other env variables set by Bazel. These should be stable between
# versions of Bazel because they are documented:
#  https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#run

current_dir=$(pwd)

# soon we will use one of the jdk locations already known to Bazel, see Issue #16
