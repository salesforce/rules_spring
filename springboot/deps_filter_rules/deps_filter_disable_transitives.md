# `deps_filter_disable_transitives` Rule
## Overview
The `deps_filter_disable_transitives` rule gives you control over transitive dependencies by disabling their resolution for specific dependencies. Inspired by [Gradle's transitive dependency resolution rule](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/resolution_rules.html#sec:disabling-resolution-transitive-dependencies), itâ€™s useful for excluding problematic dependencies from your project.

## Rule Definition
This rule filters out transitives of the specified dependencies and JARs from the compile-time and runtime dependencies.

```
deps_filter_disable_transitives(
    name = <string>,
    deps = <list of labels>,
    runtime_deps = <list of labels>,
    deps_to_exclude_transitives = <list of labels>,
    testonly = <boolean, default = False>,
)
```

### Attributes:
- `name` (Required): Name of the target.
- `deps` (Required): List of dependencies to include.
- `runtime_deps` (Optional): List of runtime dependencies to include.
- `deps_to_exclude_transitives` (Optional): List of dependencies for which transitive dependencies should be 
  excluded. (must be a subset of `deps` + `runtime_deps`)
- `testonly` (Optional, Default: False): Restricts usage to test environments.


## Adding to Your Project
### Step 1: Add `rules_spring` to your workspace:
Follow the steps mentioned [here](../../README.md#loading-the-spring-rules-in-your-workspace). 

### Step 2: Load the `deps_filter_disable_transitives` rule in your BUILD file:
```
load("@rules_spring//springboot/deps_filter_rules:deps_filter_disable_transitives.bzl", "deps_filter_disable_transitives")
```

### Step 3: Define and reference the `deps_filter_disable_transitives` in other targets (e.g., `java_library`) to manage their dependencies:
```
load("@rules_spring//springboot/deps_filter_rules:deps_filter_disable_transitives.bzl", "deps_filter_disable_transitives")

deps = [
    ...
]

runtime_deps = [
    ...
]

deps_filter_disable_transitives(
    name = "filtered_deps",
    deps = deps,
    runtime_deps = runtime_deps,
    deps_to_exclude_transitives = ["@maven//:some_dep_whose_transitives_you_dont_want",]
)

java_library(
    name = "my_library",
    deps = [":filtered_deps"], # <--- KEY LINE: USE YOUR FILTERED DEPS HERE!
    ...
)

# the filter is not specific to springboot apps, but is often used for springboot
# due to the complexity of classpaths in springboot apps
salesforce_springboot(
    name = "myspringboot_app",
    java_library = ":my_library",
)
```

## Example Usage
### Example 1
```
deps_filter_disable_transitives(
    name = "filtered_deps_disable_transitives_case_A",
    deps = [
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc",
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web",
    ],
    deps_to_exclude_transitives = [
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc",
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web",
    ],
)
```
#### Behavior:
The build includes `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc` and `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web`, but all transitive dependencies of both are excluded.

### Example 2
```
deps_filter_disable_transitives(
    name = "filtered_deps_disable_transitives_case_A",
    deps = [
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc",
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web",
    ],
    deps_to_exclude_transitives = [
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web",
    ],
)
```
#### Behavior:
- The build includes `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc` and its transitive dependencies, as well as `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web`.
- Transitive dependencies of `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web` are excluded, but transitive dependencies of 
  `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc` are included.

### Example 3
```
deps_filter_disable_transitives(
    name = "filtered_deps_disable_transitives_case_A",
    deps = [
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc",
        "@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web",
    ],
)
```
#### Behavior:
- The build includes `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_jdbc` and `@maven//:org_springframework_spring_web`, along with their respective transitive dependencies.
- No dependencies are excluded.
